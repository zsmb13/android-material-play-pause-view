# MaterialPlayPauseView
 
A View that can be toggled between play/pause states with Material Design animation.

This an improvement over [OHoussein's fork of PlayPauseView](https://github.com/OHoussein/android-material-play-pause-view).

Fixes from there:
* Fix for button state getting confused with rapid toggle events
* Proper publication mechanism

<div  align="center">    
<img src="./media/demo.gif" alt="demo" align=center />
</div>

**Usage Sample**

For now, add my Bintray repository to your `repositories` block (jcenter coming soon):
```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://dl.bintray.com/zsmb13/android-material-play-pause-view/' }
}
```

And then the dependency itself:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'co.zsmb:playpauseview:1.0.4'
}
```

#### layout

```xml
<com.ohoussein.playpause.PlayPauseView
    android:id="@+id/play_pause_view"
    android:layout_width="200dp"
    android:layout_height="200dp"
    android:clickable="true"
    android:foreground="?android:selectableItemBackground"
    app:fill_color="#e1e1e1"
    app:pause_bg="#00a2ed"
    app:play_bg="#001eff" />
```

* pause_bg : the background for the pause status
* play_bg : the background for the play status
* fill_color: the icon's color

#### Java

```java
PlayPauseView view = (PlayPauseView) findViewById(R.id.play_pause_view);
view.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
        view.toggle();
    }
});
```

You can use also `PlayPauseView#change(boolean isPlay)` to change play/pause state with animation.
